# Welcome to #defeatcovid19 - onboarding message

Dear Fellow,

I am writing this email to welcome you to our group and give a few more details.

## Why did we start this?

We live in Italy, and as you probably know, we're in the middle of the Covid-19 outbreak. Last week, I was discussing with my boss the current status and how we could help to improve the situation. In the meantime, similar discussions happened with partners, doctors, and friends about what can to do to gain a better understanding of this disease and improve diagnosis techniques. We reached out to fellow teams at ValueChina, Looptribe, Nestore, and PoliMI. We found them with the same desire to contribute: there is much that can be done to support all the medical personnel fighting every day against Covid-19.

In just a few days, we got in touch with as many doctors as we could, to ask them how we could help. Sooner, they came back to us with enthusiasm and outlined some ideas regarding medical imaging used to diagnose interstitial pneumonia.

Here is when this story becomes **your** story. We decided to devote our team expertise to this effort, and every piece of technology we have that can be helpful. More importantly, we decided to fight this battle together, sharing ideas, technology, and contributions.

In a matter of hours, the [defeatcovid19.org](https://www.defeatcovid19.org) group was born and open to everyone willing to contribute.

Our goal is to share every bit of knowledge we'll build to help people either in Italy or in other countries. All the results, datasets, and models will be released **open source** and published on our Github account. Everyone is encouraged to contribute and onboard new fellows in this battle. Companies that want to support the group offering access to their technology are welcome as well.

## Why medical imaging?

Covid-19 diagnosis requires some steps after patients' hospitalization after they show some infection symptoms. One of the most resolutive diagnosis steps involves lung RX or CT to detect the nature and extension of damage. Moreover, there is a strong focus on RX rather than CT due to the speed of patient tests and portability of devices, allowing to diagnose pneumonia even without moving people from their beds.
Moreover, lung radiography is also involved during patient recovery to understand therapy impact better and come out with a prognosis.
A trained deep learning model, able to detect lung damages (the so-called interstitial pneumonia), could support doctors from the very beginning and relief operative pressure.

Thanks to our doctors, we're also moving further considering ultrasound imaging and its involvement in the clinical diagnosis of Covid-19 impact and how it impacts the heart and lungs. More on this soon after we start collecting the first set of data.

## What happens now?

We're onboarding people and companies into this group (please share with anyone you think could help). We aim to be inclusive and supportive: this group grounds on the principle of sharing knowledge and resources between all the contributors.
In the meantime, we're discussing with s hospitals in Italy to build as many datasets as we can and offer them to everyone willing to analyze them.

Our group meets on Telegram at [https://t.me/defeatcovid19_org](https://t.me/defeatcovid19_org), join us!

We're also opening the official [GitHub organization](https://github.com/defeatcovid19/), with useful resources, and, as soon as we have them, all the datasets.

That's all for now. We have a bunch of ideas we can't wait to discuss with you in the next days.

In the meantime, feel free to reach out directly to us through [support@defeatcovid19.org](mailto:support@defeatcovid19.org) for any questions or suggestions.

We're here to help, share, and **#defeatcovid19**.

Thank you,<br/>
Luca
